Very terse deployment instructions for this webapp.

Upload Tricoder replaces the "legacy" CGI webapp that uploads files to temporary directory where the
batch system can get to them.

It is a knock-off the webapp portion of the Bulk Media Uploader.

To deploy it on an IS&T server (RHEL VM):

* Clone this repo (pahma_project) and install and configure the Django
  webapp "as usual".

* Ensure that the "batch_code" directory is present and set in uploadtricoder.cfg.
  (i.e. usually it is /home/app_webapps/batch_barcode, SELinux tags=???,
  permissions=writable by Apache user, on UCB webapps, app_webapps)

* Alas, there is no way to test this webapp except to upload some files.

* Typically every hour, a cron job runs the batch process (not described here)
